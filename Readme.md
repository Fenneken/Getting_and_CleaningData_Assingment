    + Downloading the data and creating the respective datasets.
    + Merging the train and test datasets.
    + Extract those measurments only related to the mean and standard deviation. 
    + Renaming the name of the variables to make it more readable to people.
    + Creating the final table which shows the mean and standard deviation according to the subject and activity. 
    
* ```CodeBook.md``` will go into detail without showing any form of codingon the how data was manipulated in order to create the final table ```Assingment_table.txt```

* ```Assingment_table.txt``` is the final table with the required specifications stated in the assingment.
